# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend and backend? What are they used for?

I've used axios on the backend to handle promises and lodash on the frontend to iterate on arrays without breaking the page when 0 results where returned and also make an additional operation (capitalize results).

# General:

### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?

Something around 10 to 12 hours.

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

There're three things that I think are necessary in order to have a better result:
1- Paginate the results in order to improve user experience
2- Remove inline styles and perhaps use styled components to help
3- Create new components based on the hole funcitonality, eg. SearchTools.

Those are pretty simple things to be done, but in order to be able to deliver the result within the expected time and the needed learning curve I've opted on folowwing the presented methods.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I'm proud of the backend part i thought it was pretty simple to achive the result, however even with a lot of room to improvements getting to now a bit of React made everything more interesting even without achieving perfection.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

Approximately 75% of time was spent on front-end due to my limited knowledge on react.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.

Test seems pretty straight forward, there are a few tasks to be completed and it seems to be very feasible.
